    <h1>Homepage of Axel Kölschbach Ortego</h1>
      
    <p>
        I'm a maths master student at the university of Bonn. I am interested in Algebraic Geometry and Number Theory. Last year I was in Cambridge taking Part III. Before that I was a bachelor student at Bonn. My bachelor thesis can be found <a href="https://akoelschbach.github.io/Arbeit.pdf">here</a>. You can send me an email to koelschbach at uni-bonn dot de.

    <h3>Teaching – Local fields and class field theory</h3>

    <p>
        This term, I am the teaching assistant for a class on local fields and class field theory by <a href="http://www.braunling.org">Dr. Oliver Bräunling</a>. I am offering two exercise sessions, on
        <ul>
            <li>Mondays, at 4ct in seminar room N0.007 </li>
            <li>Thursdays, at 2st in seminar room 1.008</li>
      </ul>
     On the 1st of November there is no tutorial because of a bank holiday ("Allerheiligen"). So next Thursday we will discuss both exercise sheets 2 and 3. This will be rather rushed, so if you want to see more detailed solutions you should consider going to the Monday sessions.
    </p>
The example sheets will appear here every week. They should be handed in Tuesdays at the lecture.
    <ul>
            <li><a href="https://akoelschbach.github.io/Zettel1.pdf">Sheet 1</a></li>
           <li><a href="https://akoelschbach.github.io/Zettel2.pdf">Sheet 2</a> </li>
            <li><a href="https://akoelschbach.github.io/Zettel3.pdf">Sheet 3</a></li>

      </ul>
    
    
    <h3>Study group – Berkeley lectures on p-adic geometry</h3>
    <p></p>
    The goal is to go carefully through Scholze's Berkeley lectures. The idea is to meet for the following:
    <ul>
     <li>Watch the <a href="http://www.msri.org/web/msri/online-videos/scholze-lecture-fall-2014">original videos</a> together, and stop them when someone has a question to discuss it in the group.</li>
        <li>Read the updated <a href="http://www.math.uni-bonn.de/people/scholze/Berkeley.pdf">lecture notes</a>. When things have changed compared to the original lectures, a participant will give a talk to explain it. </li>
     <li>Occasionally, we will have Q&amp;A-sessions with Peter Scholze.</li>
    </ul>
    
    Students at an advanced master level or further are welcome to attend. We have booked room N0.008 at 6pm on Mondays, Tuesdays and Fridays, but we could also change it to other dates (if rooms are available).
    <ul>
        <li> Monday 22nd October 6ct, N0.008 – 1st video and plan for the next sessions. </li>
        <li> Tuesday 23rd October 6st, N0.008 – 2nd video "adic spaces 1" </li>
        <li> Friday 26th October 6st, N0.008 – 3rd video "adic spaces 2" </li>
        <li> Tuesday 30th October 6st, 0.006 - rest of 3rd video and discussion of pre-adic spaces. </li>
        <li> Friday 2nd November 6st, N0.008 – 4th video "complements on adic spaces"</li>
        <li> Monday 5th November 6st, N0.007 - 5th video "Perfectoid spaces 1"</li>
        <li> Friday 9th November 6st, N0.008 - Sousperfectoid rings; tilting induces a homeomorphism on Spa.</li>
