    <h1>Homepage of Axel Kölschbach Ortego</h1>

    <p>
        I'm a maths master student at the university of Bonn. I am interested in Algebraic Geometry and Number Theory. Last year I was in Cambridge taking Part III. Before that I was a bachelor student at Bonn. My bachelor thesis can be found <a href="https://akoelschbach.github.io/Arbeit.pdf">here</a>.

    <h3>Teaching – Local fields and class field theory</h3>

    <p>
        This term, I am the teaching assistant for a class on local fields and class field theory by <a href="http://www.braunling.org">Dr. Oliver Bräunling</a>. I am offering two exercise sessions, on
        <ul>
            <li>Mondays, at 2ct in seminar room N0.007 (tbc)</li>
            <li>Thursdays, at 2ct in seminar room 1.008</li>
      </ul>
      On the week of 15th to the 19th of October, there will be no exercise session, because I am not in Bonn.
    </p>
The example sheets will appear here every week. They should be handed in Tuesdays at the lecture.
